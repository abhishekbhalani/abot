# Abot C# Web Crawler #

Abot is an open source C# web crawler built for speed and flexibility. It takes care of the low level plumbing (multithreading, http requests, scheduling, link parsing, etc..). You just register for events to process the page data. You can also plugin your own implementations of core interfaces to take complete control over the crawl process.

Abot targets .NET version 4.0.

<font color='red'>Source code has been moved to <a href='http://github.com/sjdirect/abot/'>http://github.com/sjdirect/abot/</a>. However, this is still the home for all documentation and the downloads tab will always have the latest. Why? Because of github's almighty pull request and forking features make it easier for others to contribute. Hint Hint!!!</font>
