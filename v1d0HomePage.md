# Abot C# Web Crawler #

Abot is an open source C# web crawler built for speed and flexibility. It takes care of the low level plumbing (multithreading, http requests, scheduling, link parsing, etc..). You just hook into key events to process data or plugin your own implementations of core interfaces to take complete control over the crawl process.

Abot targets .NET version 4.5.

## What's So Great About It? ##
  * Open Source (Free for commercial and personal use)
  * Speed (No overhead for useless features)
  * Every part of the architecture is pluggable (Dependency Injection)
  * Heavily unit tested (High code coverage)
  * Very lightweight and straight forward (No bloated classes/configurations)
  * No database required
  * Crawl decisions are easily customized (When to crawl a page, when not to crawl, when to crawl page's links, etc..)
